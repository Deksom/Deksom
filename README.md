## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Deksom, a beginner Front-End Developer, based in Germany.

Just diving into the world of Front-End development, and loving every bit of the journey! I'm all about creating clean, simple, and nice-looking websites that actually work well.

I'm still learning and growing, but I'm motivated and ready to take on cool projects - from building landing pages to tweaking layouts or making designs come alive in code.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably deep into some gameðŸŽ® or watching something on NetflixðŸ“º.
